Introducing the fundamental concepts of digital image processing, which is a critical foundation for computer vision algorithms, including AI vision applications.


Computer vision is a rapidly developing field of study that involves analyzing and processing digital images to extract useful information. This has led to the development of various artificial intelligence (AI) applications that have proven to be useful in different sectors, such as healthcare, transportation, and security.

The project comprises of two parts. The first part involves loading a supplied script and running it on Google Colab. The script includes several tasks, such as loading an image, performing image segmentation, and image filtering.

The second part of the project involves an experiment with a Deep Learning model implemented using the Keras framework. The experiment entails training a model to classify handwritten digits and evaluating its performance by calculating accuracy metrics. I will be changing the number of training epochs, getting new results, including new accuracy, and visualizing and reflecting on the results with the original number of epochs. I will also explore alternatives to the default model parameters, such as loss, optimizer, and metrics, experiment with the alternatives, visualize and report the results, and interpret them.
